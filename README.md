# Virtual_Mouse


This project involves developing a Virtual Mouse using Python, pyautogui, MediaPipe, and OpenCV (cv2). The system functions as an air mouse, allowing users to control the cursor through hand gestures. It captures motion data, processes it to determine cursor movement, and then uses pyautogui to control the cursor on the screen. This project combines elements of human-computer interaction, which focuses on designing and implementing user-friendly interfaces, with computer vision, which enables the interpretation of visual data from the hand gestures.\
